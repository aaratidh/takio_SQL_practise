+----------------+----------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
 
 
Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".
Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.
The query result format is in the following example.
 
Example 1:
Input: 
Cinema table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |

| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Explanation: 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.


select * from Cinema 
where (descripition != "Boring" ) and  (mod(id,2) <> 0)
