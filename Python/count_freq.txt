Problem Statement
Write a Python function that counts the frequency of each word in a given paragraph. The function should return the result as a dictionary. Additionally, provide a way to retrieve the most frequently occurring word(s) from this dictionary
 
input_paragraph = "Hello world Hello world This world is full of surprises Surprises are everywhere; surprises are fun"

 
{

    'hello': 2,

    'world': 3,

    'this': 1,

    'is': 1,

    'full': 1,

    'of': 1,

    'surprises': 3,

    'are': 3,

    'everywhere': 1,

    'fun': 1

}

Most frequent word(s): ['world', 'surprises']

#solution 

from utility import generate_dict
from utility import  count_freq

if __name__ == '__main__':
    input_paragraph = 'Hello world Hello world This world is full of surprises Surprises are everywhere surprises are fun'
    input_paragraph  = input_paragraph.lower()
    words1 = input_paragraph.split()
    print("after converting para  into list of word\n ", words1)
    Dic_para = generate_dict(words1)
    print(" dictionary of paragraph",Dic_para)
    count_freq(Dic_para)




#inside utility function

def generate_dict(ll):
    d = {}
    count = 0
    for x in ll:
        if x in d:
            d[x] = d[x] + 1
        else:
            d[x] = 1
    return(d)

def count_freq(dictnum):
    max_list = {}
    max = list(dictnum.values())[0]
    for x in dictnum:
        if max < dictnum[x]:
            max = dictnum[x]
    for  x in dictnum:
        if dictnum[x] == max :
            max_list[x] = max
    print(max_list)







#output 
{'world': 3, 'surprises': 3}
