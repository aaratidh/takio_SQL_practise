problem statement:


#Find All Pairs in a List that Sum to a Specific Value
#Write a Python function to find all pairs in a list that sum to a specific value.

Input= [1, 2, 3 , 3, 4, 5]
Sum=6


Solution

read  = set()
pair_list = []


for x in Input:
    diff = Sum - x
    if diff  in read:
        pair_list.append((min(x, diff), max(x, diff)))
    read.add(x)


print(pair_list)


Output: [(1, 5), (2, 4)]
